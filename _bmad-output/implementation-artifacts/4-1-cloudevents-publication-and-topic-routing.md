# Story 4.1: CloudEvents Publication & Topic Routing

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a **platform developer**,
I want persisted events published to DAPR pub/sub using CloudEvents 1.0 on per-tenant-per-domain topics,
So that subscribers receive events scoped to their authorized tenant and domain.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **CloudEvents 1.0 envelope** - Given events are persisted by the aggregate actor, When the event publisher runs, Then each event is published as a CloudEvents 1.0 envelope via DAPR pub/sub (FR17) with metadata: `cloudevent.type` = EventTypeName, `cloudevent.source` = `hexalith-eventstore/{tenantId}/{domain}`, `cloudevent.id` = `{correlationId}:{sequenceNumber}`.

2. **Per-tenant-per-domain topic routing** - Given events are published, When the topic name is derived, Then it follows the pattern `{tenant}.{domain}.events` (D6, FR19) using `AggregateIdentity.PubSubTopic`.

3. **At-least-once delivery** - Given a subscriber is listening on a tenant-domain topic, When events are published, Then the subscriber receives events with at-least-once delivery guarantee (FR18) via DAPR pub/sub semantics. **Note:** This is a DAPR runtime guarantee — verified by config inspection only, no new test needed. Subscriber idempotency is the consumer's responsibility.

4. **Never-throw on publication failure** - Given pub/sub is unavailable, When EventPublisher attempts to publish, Then it returns `EventPublishResult(Success: false, ...)` instead of throwing (enables drain recovery in Story 4.2).

5. **Configurable pub/sub component name** - Given the `EventStore:Publisher:PubSubName` configuration, When events are published, Then the configured pub/sub component is used (default: `"pubsub"`).

6. **OpenTelemetry tracing** - Given events are published, When the EventPublisher runs, Then an `EventStore.Events.Publish` activity is created with tags: correlationId, tenantId, domain, aggregateId, eventCount, topic.

7. **Structured logging compliance** - Given events are published successfully, When logging occurs, Then it includes correlationId, tenantId, topic, eventCount at Information level. On failure, logs at Error level with correlationId and topic. Never logs event payload data (NFR12).

8. **Topic name validation** - Given a derived topic name, When validated by `TopicNameValidator`, Then it must match `^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.events$` and not exceed 249 characters.

9. **All existing tests pass** - All Tier 1 (baseline: >= 544) and Tier 2 (baseline: >= 1228) tests continue to pass after all changes.

### Definition of Done

This story is complete when: all 9 ACs are verified against existing code, the 3 new tests from Task 6 are added and passing, and no regressions exist in Tier 1 or Tier 2 suites.

### Scope Constraint

**This is a verification story.** The only code changes are new test files added in Task 6. Do NOT modify any `src/` files unless a gap analysis reveals an actual bug. Do NOT refactor, "improve," or restructure existing code.

## Implementation Status Assessment

**CRITICAL CONTEXT: Story 4.1 is fully implemented.** All event publishing infrastructure was built during previous epic work. This story is a **verification and gap-analysis pass** — the dev agent should confirm correctness, ensure test coverage is complete, and close identified test gaps (Tasks 6.1, 6.6).

### Cross-Story Dependencies

- **Story 4.2 (Resilient Publication & Backlog Draining)** depends on this story's `EventPublisher` never-throw contract and `EventPublishResult` to trigger drain recovery via `UnpublishedEventsRecord` and DAPR actor reminders.
- **Story 4.3 (Per-Aggregate Backpressure)** depends on the pub/sub topic routing established here to apply per-aggregate command queue depth limits.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 0: Verify prerequisites and baseline (BLOCKING)
  - [ ] 0.1 **Prerequisite:** Tier 2 tests require DAPR slim init (`dapr init --slim`). Confirm DAPR is initialized before running Tier 2.
  - [ ] 0.2 Run all Tier 1 tests — confirm all pass (baseline: >= 544)
  - [ ] 0.3 Run Tier 2 tests `Hexalith.EventStore.Server.Tests` — confirm pass count (baseline: >= 1228)
  - [ ] 0.4 Read `EventPublisher.cs` fully — verify CloudEvents metadata injection matches AC #1
  - [ ] 0.5 Read `AggregateIdentity.cs` — verify `PubSubTopic` property returns `{TenantId}.{Domain}.events` (AC #2)
  - [ ] 0.6 Read `TopicNameValidator.cs` — verify regex and 249-char limit (AC #8)
  - [ ] 0.7 Read `AggregateActor.cs` pipeline step 5 — verify persist-then-publish flow and checkpoint stages
  - [ ] 0.8 Read `EventPublisherOptions.cs` — verify `PubSubName` default is `"pubsub"` (AC #5)
  - [ ] 0.9 Read `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` DI registration — verify all pub/sub services registered

**Note:** Tasks 1-5 are independent verification reads with no code changes. They may be parallelized.

- [ ] Task 1: Verify CloudEvents 1.0 compliance (AC: #1)
  - [ ] 1.1 Confirm `cloudevent.type` is set to `eventEnvelope.EventTypeName` (not kebab-case MessageType)
  - [ ] 1.2 Confirm `cloudevent.source` follows `hexalith-eventstore/{tenantId}/{domain}` format
  - [ ] 1.3 Confirm `cloudevent.id` follows `{correlationId}:{sequenceNumber}` format (unique per event)
  - [ ] 1.4 Verify DAPR's native CloudEvents 1.0 wrapping is preserved (no custom envelope serialization)
  - **Reference:** `EventPublisher.cs` L99-102 constructs the metadata dictionary:
    ```csharp
    var metadata = new Dictionary<string, string> {
        ["cloudevent.type"] = eventEnvelope.EventTypeName,
        ["cloudevent.source"] = $"hexalith-eventstore/{identity.TenantId}/{identity.Domain}",
        ["cloudevent.id"] = $"{correlationId}:{eventEnvelope.SequenceNumber}",
    };
    ```

- [ ] Task 2: Verify topic routing and configurable pub/sub name (AC: #2, #5, #8)
  - [ ] 2.1 Confirm `AggregateIdentity.PubSubTopic` returns `{TenantId}.{Domain}.events`
  - [ ] 2.2 Confirm `NamingConventionEngine.GetPubSubTopic` returns the same pattern
  - [ ] 2.3 Confirm `TopicNameValidator` regex accepts valid topics and rejects invalid ones
  - [ ] 2.4 Verify tenant/domain inputs are forced to lowercase on `AggregateIdentity` construction
  - [ ] 2.5 Confirm `EventPublisherOptions.PubSubName` flows through to `DaprClient.PublishEventAsync` first parameter (AC #5) — trace from options binding in DI through `EventPublisher` constructor to the publish call

- [ ] Task 3: Verify at-least-once delivery guarantee (AC: #3) — config inspection only, no new test needed
  - [ ] 3.1 Confirm DAPR pub/sub component config specifies at-least-once delivery (not exactly-once)
  - [ ] 3.2 Confirm `pubsub.yaml` (local) has `enableDeadLetter: true` for undeliverable messages
  - [ ] 3.3 Confirm production `pubsub-*.yaml` configs maintain at-least-once semantics
  - [ ] 3.4 Confirm subscriber idempotency is the consumer's responsibility (DAPR guarantee, not application code)

- [ ] Task 4: Verify never-throw failure handling (AC: #4)
  - [ ] 4.1 Confirm `EventPublisher.PublishEventsAsync` catches exceptions and returns `EventPublishResult(Success: false, ...)`
  - [ ] 4.2 Confirm `OperationCanceledException` is the only exception that propagates (cancellation token)
  - [ ] 4.3 Confirm partial failure is tracked via `PublishedCount` (events published before failure)
  - [ ] 4.4 Review `EventPublisherRetryComplianceTests` — confirm no custom retry logic (Rule #4)

- [ ] Task 5: Verify OpenTelemetry and logging (AC: #6, #7)
  - [ ] 5.1 Confirm `EventStoreActivitySource.EventsPublish` activity with required tags exists
  - [ ] 5.2 Confirm success logs at Information level with correlationId, tenantId, topic, eventCount
  - [ ] 5.3 Confirm failure logs at Error level with correlationId and topic
  - [ ] 5.4 Confirm no event payload data appears in logs (NFR12 compliance)

- [ ] Task 6: Close identified test gaps
  - [ ] 6.1 **Add test** `PublishEventsAsync_DifferentTenants_ProduceDifferentTopics` in `EventPublisherTests.cs` — publish events for `AggregateIdentity("acme", "orders", "order-1")` and `AggregateIdentity("contoso", "orders", "order-1")`, verify DAPR receives calls with topics `acme.orders.events` and `contoso.orders.events` respectively. **Rationale:** Existing tests use a single `TestIdentity` — no multi-tenant topic derivation coverage. This is a real isolation boundary.
  - [ ] 6.2 **Add test** `PublishEventsAsync_DifferentDomains_ProduceDifferentTopics` — same tenant, different domains (`payments` vs `orders`), verify distinct topics `acme.payments.events` vs `acme.orders.events`.
  - [ ] 6.3 End-to-end integration test (command → actor → persist → publish → subscriber receives CloudEvents envelope) is deferred to Tier 3 (requires full DAPR runtime + subscriber). No action needed here.
  - [ ] 6.4 Run all Tier 1 + Tier 2 tests — confirm no regressions from new tests
  - [ ] 6.5 **Add test** `PublishEventsAsync_BoundaryTenantIds_ProducesValidTopics` in `EventPublisherTests.cs` — test boundary-case `AggregateIdentity` values that pass existing `AggregateIdentity` constructor validation (check min/max length constraints first): e.g., shortest valid tenant, longest valid tenant (up to 63 chars if allowed), hyphenated tenant (`"my-tenant"`). Verify each produces a valid topic and `DaprClient.PublishEventAsync` receives the correct derived topic. **Rationale:** `TopicNameValidator` tests exist standalone, but the defense-in-depth chain (AggregateIdentity → publisher → DAPR call) is untested for edge cases.
  - [ ] 6.6 Report final test count delta (expected: +3 to +4 new tests in `EventPublisherTests.cs`)

- [ ] Task 7: Final verification
  - [ ] 7.1 Confirm all 9 acceptance criteria are satisfied
  - [ ] 7.2 Run `dotnet build Hexalith.EventStore.slnx --configuration Release` — zero warnings
  - [ ] 7.3 Run all Tier 1 tests — pass count >= 544 (may be higher if Story 3.6 merged)
  - [ ] 7.4 Run all Tier 2 tests — pass count >= 1228 (may be higher if Story 3.6 merged)
  - [ ] 7.5 If any new tests added, report final test count delta

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Compliance

- **ADR-P2 (Persist-Then-Publish):** Events MUST be persisted to state store BEFORE publishing to pub/sub. The actor pipeline enforces this ordering: `EventsStored` checkpoint → `PublishEventsAsync` → `EventsPublished` checkpoint. Never reverse this order.
- **D6 (Topic Naming):** Topics follow `{tenant}.{domain}.events` (dot-separated). The `AggregateIdentity.PubSubTopic` property is the single source of truth for topic derivation.
- **Rule #4 (No Custom Retry):** `EventPublisher` delegates all retry logic to DAPR resiliency policies. Application code never retries pub/sub calls.
- **Rule #5 (No Payload Logging):** Event payload data (`byte[] Payload`) is never logged or included in telemetry. Only envelope metadata fields.
- **OTel Activity Naming:** Event publishing activity must be named `EventStore.Events.Publish` (per architecture doc activity naming table). Tags: `correlationId`, `tenantId`, `domain`, `aggregateId`, `eventCount`, `topic`.
- **Rule #11 (Write-Once Events):** Event store keys are immutable. Publication is a distribution mechanism; the state store is the source of truth.

| `src/Hexalith.EventStore.Server/Events/IEventPublisher.cs` | Publication contract |
| `src/Hexalith.EventStore.Server/Events/EventPublishResult.cs` | Result record |

| `src/Hexalith.EventStore.Server/Configuration/EventPublisherOptions.cs` | Pub/sub component config |
| `src/Hexalith.EventStore.Contracts/Identity/AggregateIdentity.cs` | Topic derivation (`PubSubTopic`) |
| `src/Hexalith.EventStore.Server/Actors/AggregateActor.cs` | Pipeline step 5 (publish) |
| `src/Hexalith.EventStore.AppHost/DaprComponents/pubsub.yaml` | Local pub/sub config |
| `tests/Hexalith.EventStore.Server.Tests/Events/EventPublisherTests.cs` | Unit tests (13 tests) |

### DAPR Pub/Sub Configuration

**Local (AppHost):** Redis pub/sub with dead-letter enabled, publishing scopes restrict domain services (not commandapi).

**Production (deploy/):** Three backend options — RabbitMQ, Kafka, Azure Service Bus. All support CloudEvents 1.0 + at-least-once delivery (NFR28).

**Scoping model (3 layers):**
1. Component scopes — which apps can access the pub/sub component at all
2. Publishing scopes — which apps can publish to which topics
3. Subscription scopes — which apps can subscribe to which topics

CommandApi has unrestricted publishing access (required for dynamic tenant topic creation — NFR20).

### Testing Standards

- **Framework:** xUnit 2.9.3 / Shouldly 4.3.0 / NSubstitute 5.3.0
- **Tier 2 tests** use `NSubstitute.For<DaprClient>()` to mock DAPR SDK calls
- **Test naming:** `{Method}_{Scenario}_{ExpectedResult}`
- **No custom retry in tests** — DAPR resiliency is tested via retry compliance tests that verify no retry loops exist

### Previous Story Intelligence

**Story 3.6 (OpenAPI Specification & Swagger UI)** — most recent story (in review):
- Format pattern: Implementation Status Assessment table + task list with subtask checkboxes
- Used `[Source: file#section]` references
- Blockers identified upfront in Task 0
- Stories 3.1-3.6 established the full CommandApi + error handling + auth pipeline

**Stories under old epic structure** already built the EventPublisher, TopicNameValidator, and full actor pipeline. The new epic 4 structure maps this existing work to formalized acceptance criteria.

### Project Structure Notes

All source files align with the architecture's file tree specification:
- Event publishing in `Server/Events/` (feature folder)
- Configuration in `Server/Configuration/`
- Actor integration in `Server/Actors/`
- Contracts in `Contracts/Identity/` and `Contracts/Commands/`
- Tests mirror source structure in `Server.Tests/Events/`, `Server.Tests/Security/`, etc.

No file relocations or restructuring needed.
